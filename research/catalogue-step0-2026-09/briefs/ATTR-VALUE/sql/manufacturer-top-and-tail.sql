-- ATTR-VALUE A4 §5 · the actual manufacturer vocabulary: the head (what an option list would hold)
-- and the case-drift pairs (what normalisation alone would fix).
-- Source: solvent-staging.production_append_public (append-only CDC). Dedup: latest row per id, excluding DELETE.
-- Snapshot-bounded per BRIEF §3.4: every dedup subquery is cut at source_timestamp <= 2026-09-19 10:27:00+00
-- (INT64 epoch millis), so the result is reproducible as production keeps writing.
